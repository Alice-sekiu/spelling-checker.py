# spelling-checker.py
A simple Python package to auto detect and correct misspellings in written text.

This repo is for educational purposes. The original prototype can be found in Peter Norvig's essay ["How to write a spelling corrector"](http://norvig.com/spell-correct.html).

branch `main`: a template for setting up and distributing a Python pacakge to PyPI. Fork the repo to start using the template.

branch `feature`: contains the source code of a spelling corrector. The pacakge can be found and downloaded from [TestPyPI](https://test.pypi.org/project/spellingchecker).

branch `develop`: playground for experimental code, not intended to be functional.
